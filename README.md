# JobPortal

The key features that this portal includes are as follows:
•	Common Authentication Page – This page is a common page for both Applicants and Administrator which redirects to either “User Page” or “Admin Page” after proper authentication.
•	User page - This takes the basic details from the applicant that includes but not limited to information like First Name, Last Name, email address, user name, address, Resume (.pdf, .docx format), etc.
•	Openings – This page contains the list of all the current openings that the company is recruiting for right now.
•	Non editable job description page – This will be the next page an applicant is redirected to once the user fills in their basic details which include the description of the job they are applying for with the required qualifications and skills as desired by the company and a small “submit” button which redirects the applicant to the page which has the questionnaire for applicants to fill as a part of the entire application process.
•	Admin page – This includes the space to provide job description section, Qualifications section, Skill requirement section, etc. This is controlled by an admin user at the company’s end who is responsible for posting new jobs on the portal for applicants to apply for.
•	Postings page – Once the administrator has filled in the details regarding a job the next thing would be to see the new job posted in the list of jobs that are open right now. The admin is redirected to the “Openings” page to verify whether the new job has been added to the list successfully.
